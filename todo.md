# TODO

- [ ] Native arrays (e.g. `cs.system.Object[]` -> `cs.NativeArray<cs.system.Object>`)
= [ ] Function pointers (this will be what Haxe uses for haxe.lang.Function or whatever)
- [ ] Delegates (God, I hate Microsoft)
    - I guess make an abstract that is a delegate.. cast to and from function pointers/delegates
- [ ] Abstracts
- [ ] Inlining (the Haxe way)
- [ ] Complex pattern matching
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
